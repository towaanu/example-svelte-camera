# Camcam
Little app using web camera API and sveltejs

# Launch the app
You need docker to start the app

First go to the root of the project and do ( make sure `docker-run.sh` is executable ) : 

`./docker-run.sh`

You should have an acces to a docker container under /app.

Then we need to install packages using npm : 

`npm install`

And now, we sould be able to launch the server with the app : 

`npm run start:dev`

The app should be accessible here : https://0.0.0.0:8080
